## Background

Of the 1,200+ .gov websites, a series of straightforward scans [reveal](http://ben.balter.com/2011/09/07/analysis-of-federal-executive-domains/) a series of common ommissions and opportunities for easily-made improvements.  A simple engagement program could define a handful of criteria by which to review each .gov website at the top level and identify those which may benefit from some simple outreach and support.  This website outlines potential areas such a program could focus on.  With a moderate amount of effort, the program could achieve real and quantifiable improvement to the public's user experience and spread important best practices across the government's web presence.
